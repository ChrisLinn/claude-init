    think harder.

No need to start implementing, just read through and understand the codebase and give me a detailed plan on:

currently for `.claude/commands` & `.claude/agents`
- **If missing**: Creates with all template files
- **If exists**: Only adds missing files, preserves existing ones

I want to make:

if being run (e.g., by `npx claude-init`),

ask whether want to overwrite `.claude/commands/*.md` for the existing ones

ask whether want to install `.claude/agents`

• Here’s a concrete plan to add the interactive behavior while preserving the current “create if missing; add-only if exists” logic.

Current Behavior

- src/cli.js: Orchestrates tasks to set up CLAUDE.md, .devcontainer, .claude/settings.json, .claude/commands, .claude/agents in a fixed sequence.
- src/fileManager.js:
  - handleSelectiveFileCopy(targetDir, relPath):
      - If target dir missing → copies all template files.
      - If exists → adds only missing files; preserves existing ones.
  - handleDirectoryMirror, handleSingleFile, handleClaudeMarkdown: straightforward creation/append/skip logic.
- Templates are the repo’s own top-level files/dirs (via src/utils.js:getTemplatesPath()).

Goals

- If .claude/commands exists: prompt whether to overwrite the existing *.md files with template versions.
- Prompt whether to install .claude/agents at all.
- Default to current behavior when non-interactive (CI) or when user declines.

Design Decisions

- Prompt once for .claude/commands overwrite (not per-file). If “Yes”, overwrite existing *.md files from templates; still add any missing.
- Prompt once to include .claude/agents. If “No”, skip installing/updating agents entirely.
- Non-interactive fallback: preserve current defaults
  - Commands: do not overwrite existing files.
  - Agents: proceed to install/update as today.
- No new dependency needed; use Node’s readline to keep package small and compatible.

Implementation Plan

- Add a small prompt helper
  - File: src/prompt.js
  - Exports promptYesNo(question, defaultAnswer) that:
      - Uses readline to ask a y/N question only if process.stdin.isTTY.
      - Returns default immediately if not TTY.
- Extend selective copy to support optional overwrite
  - File: src/fileManager.js:75 (function starting at this line)
  - Change signature to handleSelectiveFileCopy(targetDir, relativePath, options = {})
      - Supported options:
          - overwriteExisting?: boolean (default: false)
          - filter?: (relPath: string) => boolean (default: include all)
      - Behavior:
          - If directory missing: copy all template files as today (unchanged).
          - If exists:
              - Build list of template files (reuse getFilesInDirectory).
              - If overwriteExisting is false (default): current behavior (copy missing only).
              - If overwriteExisting is true:
                  - For each template file that passes filter:
                      - Copy into destination with overwrite (use fs.copy with ensured dir).
                  - Track counts: addedCount for files that didn’t exist; overwrittenCount for files that did.
          - Results:
              - action: 'updated' | 'created' | 'skipped'
              - filesAdded: number
              - Optionally include filesOverwritten: number in the result for richer summary.
- Orchestrate prompts and task decisions
  - File: src/cli.js
  - Before building the tasks array (around 39–60):
      - Determine whether .claude/commands exists and has overlap:
          - Compute templateFiles for .claude/commands and targetFiles for the same.
          - If there’s at least one intersection (and TTY), ask:
              - “Overwrite existing .claude/commands/*.md with template versions? (y/N)”
              - Use a filter that only affects *.md files.
          - Save decision in overwriteCommandsMd.
      - Ask whether to include agents:
          - “Install .claude/agents files? (y/N)”
          - Save decision in includeAgents.
  - Build the tasks array with:
      - .claude/commands: call handleSelectiveFileCopy(targetDir, '.claude/commands', { overwriteExisting: overwriteCommandsMd, filter: (p) => p.endsWith('.md') })
      - .claude/agents: include this task only if includeAgents === true. If false, skip it entirely and print a short “skipped by user” line after summary.
- Output polish
  - File: src/cli.js:13–27
  - Extend formatResult to append overwritten count when present:
      - If result.filesOverwritten is defined, add , overwritten: N portion to the yellow “updated” line details.
  - After summary, print a line if agents were skipped: “- .claude/agents skipped by user”.
- Docs
  - File: README.md
  - Document interactive prompts:
      - Overwriting .claude/commands/*.md
      - Choosing to install .claude/agents
      - Non-interactive behavior defaults.
  - Optional: note an environment variable to auto-answer (future enhancement).
- Tests
  - File: test/cli.test.js
  - Add a new test block for overwrite mode at Selective file copying:
      - Create .claude/commands with a file like debug.md containing custom content.
      - Call handleSelectiveFileCopy(tempDir, '.claude/commands', { overwriteExisting: true, filter: (p) => p.endsWith('.md') }).
      - Assert:
          - result.action === 'updated'
          - filesOverwritten >= 1
          - debug.md content now equals the template version.
      - Keep existing tests intact (default remains “add-only if exists”).
  - No CLI-prompt test needed now since we isolate logic in fileManager and keep prompts in cli.

Key File References

- src/cli.js:39–60 — Replace static tasks array with decisions informed by prompts.
- src/cli.js:13–27 — Enhance formatResult to include overwrite counts when present.
- src/fileManager.js:75 — Extend handleSelectiveFileCopy to accept options and support overwriting with filter.
- src/prompt.js — New helper providing promptYesNo.

User Experience

- Default run on a fresh repo: behavior unchanged; everything installs.
- Existing .claude/commands: user gets a single prompt to overwrite existing *.md; “No” preserves customizations and still adds missing files.
- Agents: user chooses to install or skip; skip prints a clear line in output.

Edge Cases

- Non-interactive/CI: fall back to current defaults (no overwrite, install agents).
- Nested folders under commands/agents are supported (uses relative path recursion).
- Overwrite affects only files that match the .md filter under .claude/commands.
- We do not delete non-template files; we only add/overwrite template files.

If you want, I can proceed to implement exactly this with a minimal readline prompt helper and add one overwrite-mode unit test for fileManager.
